# Penetration-test-Report-
penetration test using metasploitable 3 
 I conducted a thorough penetration testing assignment targeting Metasploitable 3 to identify vulnerabilities. In this role, I designed a robust penetration testing framework based on Kali Linux, encompassing pre-attack, attack, and post-attack phases. My work involved the use of various legitimate tools and techniques, including reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities. I meticulously documented the entire process, producing a comprehensive Penetration Testing report with clear documentation and accompanying screenshots. I also conducted a Vulnerability Analysis Test, categorized vulnerabilities, and proposed technical solutions. Additionally, I developed IPTABLE rules to mitigate attacks on identified vulnerabilities, and I designed a firewall and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) solution, complete with Snort rules for breach detection. My work demonstrated my analytical skills, ethical considerations, and alignment with industry standards, making me a valuable candidate for cybersecurity positions. I bolstered my findings and recommendations with academic research, utilizing a substantial list of quality references to support my work.
